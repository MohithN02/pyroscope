### Technical Requirements

* Must follow [Charts best practices](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_best_practices/)
* Must pass CI jobs for linting and installing changed charts with the [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) tool
* Must pass Check Docs job for updating [README.md](./chart/README.md) with [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) tool, this is only required in case of any changes in [values](./chart/values.yaml)
* Any change to a chart requires a version bump following [semver](https://semver.org/) principles. See [Immutability](#immutability) and [Versioning](#versioning) below

Once changes have been merged, the release job will automatically run to package and release changed charts.

### Immutability

Chart releases must be immutable. Any change to a chart warrants a chart version bump even if it is only changed to the documentation.

### Versioning

The chart `version` should follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

Charts should start at `1.0.0`. Any breaking (backwards incompatible) changes to a chart should:

1. Bump the MAJOR version
2. In the README, under a section called "Upgrading", describe the manual steps necessary to upgrade to the new (specified) MAJOR version
